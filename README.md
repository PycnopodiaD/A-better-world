I have a PhD in Molecular biology and am currently a post-doc but this is the end of my academic carrier as I do not see a future in it. I have learnt enough and I want to move on to something practical, whether this is the way forward or something to do with permaculture I am not sure yet but I still have a lot of time. Cheers.
